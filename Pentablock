**Pentagon Data Structure: Multi-Party Smart Contract**

- **Vertices (5):** Each vertex of the pentagon represents a party involved in the contract. This could include individuals, organizations, or automated agents.
- **Edges (5):** Each edge represents a contractual agreement or condition between the parties.
- **Interior Angles:** The angles could represent the state of the contract, with specific angles indicating particular states or outcomes.
- **Area:** The area of the pentagon could represent the total value locked in the contract, with adjustments to the area reflecting changes in value.
- **Perimeter:** The perimeter could symbolize the contract's timeline, with the length correlating to the contract duration.

**Example Use Case: Supply Chain Management**

In a supply chain scenario, the pentagon could represent a contract involving a manufacturer, a supplier, a distributor, a retailer, and a customer. The edges would define the terms of service, payment conditions, delivery schedules, quality assurance, and return policies. The smart contract would automatically execute transactions and updates as conditions are met, ensuring a seamless flow of goods and payments across the supply chain.
